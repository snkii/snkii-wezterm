# WezTerm Configuration Backup

This repository is intended for **backing up and version-controlling WezTerm terminal emulator configuration files**.  
Its primary goal is to maintain consistent WezTerm settings across multiple environments (macOS, Linux, etc.) and to track configuration changes over time.

## Purpose

- Reliable backup of the WezTerm configuration (`.wezterm.lua`)
- Git-based version control for configuration changes
- Quick restoration of settings on new systems
- Safe experimentation with configuration updates
